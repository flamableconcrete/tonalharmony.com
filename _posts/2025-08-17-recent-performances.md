Tonal Harmony has been blessed with many opportunities to share music in our community throughout 2024 and 2025.

## Interfaith Firesides

We were invited to participate in several interfaith firesides across the Round Rock and Georgetown areas, joining with people of many faiths to uplift hearts through song.

## MLK Leaders Prayer Breakfast (2025)

After the 2024 breakfast was canceled due to inclement weather, we were grateful to return in 2025 to the annual [MLK Leaders Prayer Breakfast](https://www.facebook.com/GeorgetownMinisterialAlliance). We sang **MLK (U2)** as part of this meaningful community tradition.

## Interfaith Prayer Service for PEACE – Southwestern University

Most recently, Tonal Harmony performed at **Southwestern University’s Interfaith Prayer Service for PEACE** at the Lois Perkins Chapel in Georgetown, TX.
